# SPX Strategy & Informational Backtesting
All of the code here is to be used with a specially organized/filtered data set provided by CBOE for the S&P 500 Index, SPX. The code presented is used to backtest various strategies, as well as look for information regarding the index in order to find possible investment opportunities. Nothing found within this Github page should be considered financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor.

# Testing Results
Results can be found in summarized documents known as The Gourd-erly Report. A link to a Google Drive folder containing all issues of it can be found here:
